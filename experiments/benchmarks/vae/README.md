# InforMax Variational Auto Encoder (InfoMaxVAE)

The InfoMaxVAE is a variational autoencoder which uses insights from information theory to improve the learned latent space representation.

### Training and Evaluation
We adapt the original implementation of [InfoMax Variational Autoencoder](https://github.com/AliLotfi92/InfoMaxVAE) by A.L. Rezaabad and S. Vishwanath. The path to the corresponding dataset needs to be adapted directly in the files.
